// house robbery problem
// This is a classic dynamic programming problem where you want to maximize the amount of money you can
// rob from a series of houses, given that you cannot rob two adjacent houses.
// The problem can be solved using a recursive approach with memoization or a dynamic programming approach.
// The idea is to either rob the current house and skip the next one, or skip the current house and consider the next one.
// Also, there is catch to this problem that the first and last house are also adjacent, so you need to handle that case as well.
