- Types of graph:
 - Matrix Graph - a matrix item represents a node and shows where it is connected and where it is not.

 - Adj Matrix
 - Adj List
 - Edge Set - we are given set of edges {slice of pairs} and using that determine if src is connected to the destination.
 - Compositional Representation of Graph.

Tasks:
 - Create Graph Creation Code (✅)
 Next 
 - BFS and DFS.


 TODO:
  - Create Video to explain all these.
