About Heaps
- Types:
  - Min Heap:
  - Max Heap:
  - Priority Queue
    - This is a abstract Data type retrives element based on their custom priority.
- These are typically implemented using the arrays. Below are the common operations:
  - Init - Heapify an array - O(n)
  - Push - push the new element
  - Pop - remove and return the min element from the heap, then update the heap ordering.
  - Fix - Re-establishes the heap ordering after the element at index i has changed its value.
  - Remove -  remove and return the element at index i from the heap and then update the heap ordering.

Implementation:
 - using the inbuilt golang container
 - from scratch.
